        <strong><span>Louís Ryc</span></strong>: I created this initiative to share a portion of my extra funds whenever available — and whenever I can.
        If you’ve reached this page through the link on my bio and are wondering about the value’s legitimacy and the purpose of the countdown. <br><br>
        <strong><span>For your assurance</span></strong>. The prize is <strong><span>legit</span></strong>, but the value may still vary based on available funds. The countdown indicates when participation becomes available; and once it opens, it remains active only for a limited time.
        <br><br>
        The goal is simple — try your luck, and I’ll personally handle the prize.
        I understand that the amount may be small; nevertheless, I hope it’s still appreciated despite its simplicity.
        <br><br>
        Please take a moment to review the details provided throughout, especially if there’s a <span><strong>value</strong></span> displayed.
        If it appears as pending or unavailable, that’s all there is for now.
